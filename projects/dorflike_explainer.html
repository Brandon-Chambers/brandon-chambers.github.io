            <p class="subtitle">A Colony Management Game Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld and Oxygen not Included</p> <span class="status-badge">In Development</span>

        </div>
        
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Dorflike is a personal project to build a colony managegment game. The title (also a WIP) <i>Dorflike</i> is a neologism- refering to games in the style of Dwarf Fortress, colony simulation games with a deep level of simulation, down to individual characters. Built in Typescript, it is playable on the web, and already intuitive and highly performant. The game runs smoothly at sizes of 250 by 250 tiles (same size as a standard map in Rimworld) and works performantly when delegating 100s of orders performantly. Further optimizations will make the game larger while maintaining this performance. At the current state, you dwarves are capable of prioritzing orders by proximity while also prioritizing their personal needs. The game code is robust enough to run at 20X speed (and can easily be toggled to do so) with no bugs or performance issues.</p>
        

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        
        <p> First, not that the time to fulfill tasks has been greatly accelerated for the purposes of demonstrating the code, the final game will have all of these values tweaked. </p>
        
        <p>The menu on the left hand side of the play area is where you will perform most of your interactions with the world. You should start by using <i>Chop</i> and dragging to get a supply of wood for building. You can save on wood by navigating to a mountain and digging into it with <i>Mine</i>. </p>
        
        <p> When you have gathered enough wood use either <i> Walls > Wood </i> and <i> Furniture > Door </i> to build a house. Use <i> Furniture > Bed </i> to give your Dwarves a place to sleep. And finally, use the <i>Rooms > Dormitory </i> tool to denote this as a place to sleep.</p>

        <p> Outside of the Dormitory, go to <i> Furniture > Outhouse </i> and designate one or more outhouses to be built. </p>

        <p> The next need to fulfill is the Dwarfs need for food and alcohol- you can use <i>Orders > Harvest </i> to gather fruit from fruit trees. Alternatively, you can wait for your chickens to lay eggs. But the most reliable food source is to designate a growing zone with <i> Rooms > Grow </i> this will prompt the Dwarves to begin planting (potatoes are the only plant currently supported) </p>

        <p> Once you have a supply of potatoes, you should build a still (<i>Furniture > Still </i>) and with no tool selected (you can deselect your current tool quickly with <i>Q</i>) click on the still and select <i> Brew Grog from Potatoes </i> this will queue up and order for your Dwarves. </p>

        <h2>Other Features and Functions </h2>

        <p> Click on a Dwarf with no tool selected to view his or her needs. </p>

        <p> Build a Pasture and click it and you can assign your chickens to be carried there, keeping them in one location </p>

        <p> Designate a Stockpile to provide a convenient storage space for your goods. </p>
