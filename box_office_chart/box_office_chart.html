        <h2> Conclusions </h2>
        
        <p> The most obvious thing to see is just how massively Covid affected the box office. The box office cratered, and remained depressed for the next year. </p>
        
        <p> A lot has been said about whether Hollywood revenues have recovered after Covid, and this chart is pretty conclusive. Not only have they not recovered, they have not even been able to reach the steady downward trend starting from the peak at 2002. 
            What is more worrying is that this decline is largely driven by movies outside of the ten with the highest box office. The ten highest show no strong long term trend, while the losses are clearly being seen in the tail of the distribution.
